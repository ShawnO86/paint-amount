## paint-amount
```
This vuejs application takes in room measurements and sends the room information to an array of room objects which then gets stringified to a localStorage JSON object.
The localStorage object is parsed to be displayed in the "saved rooms" section of the document so their measurments can persist on the device. The user can delete rooms from the localStorage object from this section.
