# paint-amount

This is a simple Vue.js app build with the vue/cli. It takes in the room shape and displays a form based on that. The form will allow measurements to be entered and then calculate the room area to find the amount of paint needed to paint the walls and(optional) the ceiling, they may also enter how many windows and doors in that room to subtract from the total area.. The user may enter multiple rooms and see each of the measurments separately. 
The working app can be viewed at https://shawno86.github.io/paint-amount/
